# cup-detection

This is a part of the course SY32 (Image Processing and Object Detection). The goal of the project is to localize and detect the plastic cup in images that are taken and labelled by all of students studying the course. The train dataset could be found [here](https://gitlab.utc.fr/sy32/sy32-ecocup-p22/dataset/-/tree/main/). There are 2 approaches for this problem:
- Mask-RCNN
- YOLO
